Too much to list, but here's a list anyway:

* Sound
    More and better sound effects
    Music

* Engineering screen
    make comms power do something
    Some sliders set only a maximum, while others control power usage
	this is confusing.  Figure something out to make it less confusing.
	(partially done -- fuzzing the power output kind of makes the
	situation more obvious.)

* Communications screen
    Starbase comm stuff
    Enemy ship comm monitoring
    Friendly ship stuff
    bridge-to-bridge comm
    take damage into account

* Navigation screen

* Weapons screen

* Science station
  take damage into account

* Setup screen
  Try to make it more intuitive for people who are seeing it for
  the first time ever.

* write some kind of guide to hacking, to make it easier for others to
  contribute to this codebase.

* computer-controlled-ships
  loads of AI improvements and basic functionality 
  remains to be done.

* starbase behavior
  improve docking with starbase

* anomalies, etc. need to be implemented

* 3D out the window view
  Fade distant objects to black
  Represent nebulas somehow
  finish conversion to opengl

* comms screen:
  need to be able to communicate with starbases -- request
  various things of the starbase. 
  intercept chatter between enemy ships
  ??? need to figure out what the hell the comms screen is good for.

* Damage control screen:
  Make the various components of the systems less generic

* Need sound for wormhole travel
* I think the universe needs to be bigger, you can see too far out
  the main screen relative to the instruments, size of the universe.
  Or else maybe some kind of fog.
* How to represent nebulae on the main screen?
* joystick support for weapons and nav, and maybe others.
* allow mining of asteroids, asteroid mining bots or something
* trading of stuff mined from asteroids at stations.
* place stations more carefully relative to one another (not right next
  door to another station.)
* Need to be able to checkpoint-restart universe state on server side
  (how do lua scripts fit into checkpoint restart?)
* Right now, laser/torpedo collision detection is too easy/sloppy.
* more lua event callbacks, some mission scripts done with lua
  basically, flesh out the lua scripting system.
* Remove use of "heading" field in snis_entity
* Make space monster do something interesting
* Allow to somehow mine asteroids and derelicts for something (fuel?)
* make tractor beam work again/better.
* some kind of visual effect for ships that are warping

NICE TO HAVE:

* Make the universe more realistic in a variety of ways (but not too realistic,
  i.e. if the ship is the nominal size of The Enterprise, then Saturn would be
  bigger than the current known in-game universe -- obviously that is too much
  realism.   Also, have planets orbiting stars, stations orbiting planets, etc,
  instead of what we have now, which is just stuff randomly sprinkled around.
