Too much to list, but here's a list anyway:

* Sound
    More and better sound effects
    Music

* Engineering screen
    Damage reporting
    Damage repairing
    Energy distribution
    Coolant distribution(?)

* Communications screen
    Starbase comm stuff
    Enemy ship comm monitoring
    Friendly ship stuff
    bridge-to-bridge comm
    take damage into account

* Finish Navigation screen
  (various improvments.)
  take damage into account

* Finish weapons screen
  beam weapon
  take damage into account

* Science station
  take damage into account

* Setup screen
  Try to make it more intuitive for people who are seeing it for
  the first time ever.

* Some kind of session persistence so that if a network
  problem occurs, client can re-connect and pick up where
  it left off.  (This is actually already done)

* write some kind of guide to hacking, to make it easier for others to
  contribute to this codebase.

* computer-controlled-ships
  loads of AI improvements and basic functionality 
  remains to be done.

* starbase behavior
	allow docking with starbase

* asteroids/anomalies/nebulae, etc. need to be implemented

* 3D out the window view remains to be done.
  Kinda sorta done now.   Still lots of work to do though,
  view frustrum clipping in particular.

* comms screen:
  enemies need to send insults to the crew
  need to be able to communicate with starbases -- request
  various things of the starbase. 
  intercept chatter between enemy ships
  ??? need to figure out what the hell the comms screen is good for.

* Damage controll screen:
  Make the various components of the systems less generic
  and have damage distributed around to the components.
  Allow repairing/replacing of the components.  Am thinking
  replacing is better than repairing with some limited spares
  that must be refreshed at starbases.
