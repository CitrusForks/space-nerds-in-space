Too much to list, but here's a list anyway:

* Sound
    More and better sound effects
    Music

* Engineering screen
    Damage reporting
    Damage repairing
    Energy distribution
    Coolant distribution(?)

* Communications screen
    Starbase comm stuff
    Enemy ship comm monitoring
    Friendly ship stuff
    bridge-to-bridge comm
    take damage into account

* Finish Navigation screen
  (make warp work... various improvments.)
  take damage into account
* Finish weapons screen
  beam weapon
  take damage into account

* Science station
  take damage into account
* Setup screen

* Some kind of session persistence so that if a network
  problem occurs, client can re-connect and pick up where
  it left off.

* write some kind of guide to hacking, to make it easier for others to
  contribute to this codebase.

* computer-controlled-ships
  loads of AI improvements and basic functionality 
  remains to be done.

* starbase behavior
	allow docking with starbase

* asteroids/anomalies/nebulae, etc. need to be implemented

* I don't like the wrapping universe.  INstead, I think it should
  be the "known" universe with a vast empty "unknown" out there with
  some hard limits on coords at, say, +/- a half-billion units out or
  something.

* 3D out the window view remains to be done.

* comms screen:
  enemies need to send insults to the crew
  need to be able to communicate with starbases -- request
  various things of the starbase. 
  intercept chatter between enemy ships
  ??? need to figure out what the hell the comms screen is good for.
