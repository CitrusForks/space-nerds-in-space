mesh_viewer is a tool for viewing models for the game "Space Nerds In Space."  It can read STL files and a subset of OBJ files, and can also be used with the -p option to view a sphere with a cube mapped texture applied.
.SH Options:
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Invoke "planet" mode.  In this case, the filename is actually a partial filename,
and six png files are expected to exist with the given partial filename with the
digits 0-5 and ".png" appended.  So for example, if you give the partial filename
"jupiter", then the program will look for "jupiter0.png", "jupiter1.png", "jupiter2.png",
"jupiter3.png", "jupiter4.png", and "jupiter5.png".  These 6 files should be square
PNG images representing 6 faces of a cube to be mapped onto a sphere.  No sphere model
is required.  The "-p" option will cause mesh_viewer to generate its own sphere
model.
.SH BASIC OPERATION
.TP
