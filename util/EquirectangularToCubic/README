is a mixture of GPL2 and GPL 3 licensed code (see Equ2rect.java, and 
EquirectangularToCubic.java) and is not really part of Space Nerds In Space,
nor needed to build it, we are just aggregating it here for convenience as it
is useful for creating cube map textures.

Run "make help" to see how to run the program.
