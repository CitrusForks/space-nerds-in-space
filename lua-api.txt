NOTE: I am still working out what the lua api should look like, so
      all of this is subject to change.  But this is what it looks like
      now (barring bitrot of this document, which is not inconceivable.)

Space Nerds In Space lua inteface:

Locations in space nerds in space:
	x,y coords, (0,0) is the upper left of the known universe,
	TBD function to return size of known universe?

FACTIONS in snis:

        0 "Neutral",
        1 "Wallunni",
        2 "Gordouni",
        3 "Zarkon",
        4 "Vekkazi",

SHIPTYPES in snis:

	SHIP_CLASS_CRUISER 0
	SHIP_CLASS_DESTROYER 1
	SHIP_CLASS_FREIGHTER 2
	SHIP_CLASS_TANKER 3
	SHIP_CLASS_TRANSPORT 4
	SHIP_CLASS_BATTLESTAR 5
	SHIP_CLASS_STARSHIP 6
	SHIP_CLASS_ASTEROIDMINER 7
	SHIP_CLASS_SCIENCE 8
	SHIP_CLASS_SCOUT 9
	SHIP_CLASS_DRAGONHAWK 10 
	SHIP_CLASS_SKORPIO 11 
	SHIP_CLASS_DISRUPTOR 12 
	SHIP_CLASS_RESEARCH_VESSEL 13 

EVENT TYPES in snis:

	"player-respawn-event",
		arguments: object id of player
		return values: none.
	"player-death-event",
		arguments: object id of player
		return values: none.
	"player-docked-event",
		arguments: object id of player, object id of station
		return values none.

Functions which you may call from lua: 

clear_all() -- this clears the entire universe except for human controlled ships
	all objects are deleted.  Probably you only use this at the beginning of
	a mission script.

id = add_random_ship() -- adds a random ship to the universe in a random location
	returns the "id" of the ship.  If adding ship failed, -1.0 is returned.

id = add_ship(name, x, y, z, type, faction) -- adds a ship to the universe of the 
	specified type and faction at the specified locations.  If adding ship
	failed, -1.0 is returned.

id = add_starbase(x, y, z, n) - adds a starbase at location x,y with number n (0 <= n <= 99).
	the starbase will be named "SB-n"
	TODO: allow starbases to be named arbitrary strings.

id = add_planet(name, x, y, z) - adds planet at x,y with specified name, returns id of planet
	or -1.0 on failure. 

id = add_nebula(name, x, y, z, r) - adds nebula at x,y with specified radius and name,
	returns id of nebula or -1.0 on failure. 

id = add_spacemonster(name, x, y, z, r) - adds spacemonster at x,y with specified radius and name,
	returns id of spacemonster or -1.0 on failure. 

id1, id2 = add_wormhole_pair(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) - adds connected wormholes at the
	specified location, returns -1 for a wormhole id that fails to create.

(table of player ship ids) = get_list_of_players(); -- returns a table containing the
	ids of all the player ships, indexed 1..n.

x,y,z = get_object_location(object_id); -- x,y,z location coordinates of specified object.
	If the object_id does not exist (anymore), x,y,z will be nil.

move_object(object_id, x, y, z); -- move object to x, y, z location.

comms_transmission(object_id, transmission); -- causes the object to transmit the
	specified transmission via comms.

register_callback(event, callback); -- event is a string, the name of the event you wish
	to register a callback for, and	callback is a string, the name of the lua function
	you want to get called when that event occurs.  The arguments passed to the lua
	function and return values from the lua function depend on the event (see events,
	above.)

register_timer_callback(callback, timer_ticks, cookie)
	register a function to be called back in timer_ticks (each timer_tick is 1/10th second).
	the cookie value is passed to your callback function.
