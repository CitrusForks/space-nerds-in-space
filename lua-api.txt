NOTE: I am still working out what the lua api should look like, so
      all of this is subject to change.  But this is what it looks like
      now (barring bitrot of this document, which is not inconceivable.)

Space Nerds In Space lua inteface:

Locations in space nerds in space:
	x,y coords, (0,0) is the upper left of the known universe,
	TBD function to return size of known universe?

FACTIONS in snis:

        0 "Neutral",
        1 "Wallunni",
        2 "Gordouni",
        3 "Zarkon",
        4 "Vekkazi",

SHIPTYPES in snis:

	SHIP_CLASS_CRUISER 0
	SHIP_CLASS_DESTROYER 1
	SHIP_CLASS_FREIGHTER 2
	SHIP_CLASS_TANKER 3
	SHIP_CLASS_TRANSPORT 4
	SHIP_CLASS_BATTLESTAR 5
	SHIP_CLASS_STARSHIP 6
	SHIP_CLASS_ASTEROIDMINER 7
	SHIP_CLASS_SCIENCE 8
	SHIP_CLASS_SCOUT 9
	SHIP_CLASS_DRAGONHAWK 10 
	SHIP_CLASS_SKORPIO 11 
	SHIP_CLASS_DISRUPTOR 12 
	SHIP_CLASS_RESEARCH_VESSEL 13 

Functions which you may call from lua: 

clear_all() -- this clears the entire universe except for human controlled ships
	all objects are deleted.  Probably you only use this at the beginning of
	a mission script.

id = add_random_ship() -- adds a random ship to the universe in a random location
	returns the "id" of the ship.  If adding ship failed, -1.0 is returned.

id = add_ship(name, x, y, type, faction) -- adds a ship to the universe of the 
	specified type and faction at the specified locations.  If adding ship
	failed, -1.0 is returned.
