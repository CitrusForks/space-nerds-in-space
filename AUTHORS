Space Nerds In Space was written mainly by 
Stephen M. Cameron - <smcameron@users.sourceforge.net>

The 3D rendering code would not be remotely as sane as it is, and probably
wouldn't even function quite right if it weren't for the work of Jeremy Van Grinsven.

Some of the audio code was modelled very loosely on
some test programs that come with portaudio (e.g. 
callback prototype.).

And, ogg_to_pcm.c is just a hacked version of
oggdec.c from vorbistools, by Michael Smith <msmith@xiph.org>

rumble.h and rumble.c borrow heavily from Johann Deneux's fftest.c

The code for clipping triangles against the view frustrum within entity.c
is essentially a port to C of Simon Yeung's javascript code found here:
http://simonstechblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/software-rasterizer-part-2.html
It is included in Space Nerds In Space with Simon Yeung's express permission.

The quaternion library, quat.c and quat.h, originally came from
Tobias Simon here: https://github.com/TobiasSimon/quat
although considerable enhancements have been made since it was
originally imported.
