<p>Please keep in mind that this program is still very much a work in progress,
so there are a lot of rough edges and sharp corners everywhere.

<p>The source code is here:

<p>Space Nerds In Space is a cooperative multiplayer networked starship simulator for linux
inspired by <a href="http://artemis.eochu.com/">Artemis Bridge Simulator</a>.  The idea is
you get several of your friends together with their computers in a room with a projector.
One computer runs the central server simulation of the game's universe.  Each player's 
computer acts as a station on a simulated starship.  For example, there are stations for
Navigation, Weapons, Engineering, Communications, Damage Control, and the "Main View"
(an out-the-window 3d rendering.)

<p>Here is a short video of the game being played for the 2nd time ever (so it's a little rough):
