<p><b>Space Nerds In Space</b> is an open source (GPLv2) cooperative multiplayer
networked starship simulator for linux (may also work on Mac).
So go out and get together with a crew of your linux-nerd friends and their computers
in a room with a projector or TV, and go forth and explore the galaxy.

<p align=center>Here is a demo video from July 9, 2016, showing one of the mission scripts, "Saving Planet Erph".

<p>One computer runs the central server simulation of the game's universe.  Each player's 
computer acts as a station on a simulated starship.  There are stations for
<b>Navigation, Weapons, Engineering, Communications, Damage Control,</b> and <b>the "Main View",</b>
an out-the-window 3d rendering.  Multiple starships each with their own team may
connect to the server for bridge-vs-bridge combat, or for cooperative play.  Additionally,
a game master may inject and control various NPC ships into the game to entertain the
players, and scenarios may be constructed with a Lua based scripting API.

<p>Here is a short mini-documentary created at <a href="http://txrxlabs.org">the premier
hackerspace of Houston, TX, TX/RX Labs</a>, camera work and editing by Jack Younger.
This is from 2013, and the graphics and other aspects of the game are much better now,
but this video will still give you a good idea of what the game is all about.

<p>Space Nerds In Space was designed with hackerspaces in mind -- where else are you going to
find enough people to run a linux-based multi-player LAN game for Star Trek nerds but a
hackerspace?  The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jPffJyj.png">very first 3D model</a> created
for Space Nerds In Space may seem <a href="https://twitter.com/cbase">strikingly familiar</a>.
If you're a member of a hackerspace, this game is explicitly <em>made for you</em>.

<h1>Build Instructions</h1>
<h2>Step 0: Acquire Hardware and OS</h2>
<p>This is a linux game.  You will need a computer running linux.
A raspberry pi doesn't count, it's not powerful enough.  The game is
currently developed using <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Mint 17.3</a>
It is within the realm of possibility that the game could be made to build
and work on Mac OSX (it has been done before, but not within the last
couple years.)  You're on your own if you want to try to run it on Mac.

<h2>Step 1: Install Dependencies</h2>
<p><b>Build dependencies</b>
<pre>
<blockquote>
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install portaudio19-dev
apt-get install libvorbis-dev
apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
apt-get install git
apt-get install stgit
apt-get install openscad # or get it from http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
apt-get install libgtkglext1-dev
apt-get install liblua5.2-dev
apt-get install libglew1.5-dev
apt-get install libssl-dev
apt-get install libttspico-utils # for text to speech
apt-get install sox # for "play" command, used by text to speech
apt-get install espeak # optional alternative to libttspico-utils
apt-get install alsa-utils # optional alternative to sox, for "aplay" command
apt-get-install libsdl1.2-dev # optional, only needed for mesh_viewer
</blockquote>
</pre>

<blockquote>
Note: SDL should only be required if you want to build mesh_viewer,
which is a utility program for viewing 3D models, and which is not
required to run the game.  mesh_viewer uses SDL 1.2, not SDL 2.x
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to try the optional speech recognition, you will want the following packages:
<pre>
<blockquote>
apt-get install pocketsphinx-utils
apt-get install pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4
apt-get install pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4
apt-get install libpocketsphinx1
</blockquote>
</pre>

<p>The above list may be incomplete, and these are the package names on mint 17.3 / ubuntu,
so may be different on RPM based systems.

<h2>Step 2: Download the Source Code</h2>

<p>The source code is here:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space">Space Nerds In Space github page</a>
To get it, there are three methods:
<ul>
<li>If you are a registered github user, type:
<pre>
<blockquote>
git clone git@github.com:smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
<blockquote>
</pre>
<li>If not a registered github user, you can still use git with https.  Type:
<pre>
<blockquote>
git clone https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
<blockquote>
</pre>
<li>Finally, you can just download a snapshot zipfile without using git at all:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/archive/master.zip">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/archive/master.zip</a>
</ul>
<p>After downloading, you must unpack the zip file.  Type:
<pre>
<blockquote>
unzip space-nerds-in-space-master.zip 
cd space-nerds-in-space-master
</blockquote>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Build the Code</h2>
<p>To build the code, make sure you are in the top level
directory for the game ("space-nerds-in-space" if you
got the source using git, or "space-nerds-in-space-master" if you
downloaded the zip file), and type:
<pre><blockquote>
make O=1
</blockquote></pre>
<p>You should see quite a lot of output, like this:
<pre>
<blockquote>
  COMPILE mathutils.c
  COMPILE snis_alloc.c
  COMPILE snis_socket_io.c

... many steps omitted here ...

  LINK snis_server
  LINK snis_client
  LINK snis_limited_client
  LINK snis_multiverse
</blockquote>
</pre>

<p>If you have problems building the code, it likely means there is some
missing dependency.  Double check that you have all the required dependencies
installed.

<p>You can also file a bug report if you think you have discovered a problem
with the build process, or the instructions here.  I believe you will need a github
account to file a bug report.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/issues">Click here to file a bug report</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Step 4. Run the Game on a single system (Try this before trying multiplayer)</h2>
<p>Type:
<blockquote>
<pre>
	./quickstart
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: This will run both the "server" and the "client" on your machine.
After awhile, you should see a screen that looks something like this
(without the white ovals):
<p align=center><img src="network-setup.jpg", width=85%>

<ol>
<li>Click on the MAIN SCREEN ROLE checkbox to be sure it is checked.
<li>The <em>very first</em> time you run it, leave the CREATE SHIP box
checked.  On subsequent runs, make sure CREATE SHIP is not checked.
<li>Enter the name of your ship in the "SHIP NAME" field.
<li>Choose a password for your ship and enter it in the PASSWORD field.
(Note: the passwords are not cryptographically secure.)
<li>Click the "CONNECT TO LOBBY" button in the lower left part of the screen
</ol>
<p>Once connected to the lobby, you should see something like this:
<p align=center><img src="lobby1.jpg", width=85%>
<p>Click on the white text "DEFAULT2".  When you do that, you should see:
<p align=center><img src="lobby2.jpg", width=85%>
<p>Click on the "CONNECT TO SERVER" button on the right side of the screen.
After you do that, you should briefly see this:
<p align=center><img src="connecting.jpg">
<p>and then this should quickly be replaced be an "out the window" view
of space, as below, the "main screen" view of Space Nerds In Space.  It may not look
exactly like this as your ship will be placed in a semi-random location facing
an arbitrary direction.  If you've gotten this far, congratulations, you're doing
better than most.
<p align=center><img src="out-the-window.jpg", width=85%>
<h2>Step 5. Play around</h2>
<h3>Keyboard Controls</h3>
<p>The function keys are used to switch between screens, except for F1, which is the 'help' key.
<ul>
<li>F1 is the help screen.  What it displays depends on which screen you're on.
<li>F2 - NAVIGATION
<li>F3 - WEAPONS
<li>F4 - ENGINEERING
<li>F5 - DAMAGE CONTROL
<li>F6 - SCIENCE
<li>F7 - COMMUNICATIONS
<li>F8 - MAIN SCREEN
<li>F9 - DEMON SCREEN (dungeon master screen)
</ul>
<p>To quit the game, press ESC and confirm using arrow keys and ENTER.
Note, this only quits your client process.
You can re-join the server (via "./quickjoin" script)
It still leaves several processes running, the snis_server, the lobby process
and snis_multiverse.  To kill all of them, run the "./killem" script.
<h3>NAVIGATION SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the navigation screen, you can steer the ship and maneuver around. 
<p align=center><img src="navigation.png", width=85%>
<h3>WEAPONS SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the weapons screen, you can fire the laser turret and launch torpedoes.
<p align=center><img src="weapons.jpg", width=85%>
<h3>ENGINEERING SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the engineering screen, you can control how power and coolant is distributed
to the various systems of the ship.
<p align=center><img src="engineering.png", width=85%>
<h3>DAMAGE CONTROL SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the damage control screen, you can repair the various systems of the ship.
<p align=center><img src="damage-control.png", width=85%>
<h3>SCIENCE SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the science screen, you can scan ships, planets, asteroids, launch the mining
robot and help navigate to distant targets.
<p align=center><img src="science1.png", width=85%>
<p align=center>Short Range Scanner
<p align=center><img src="science2.png", width=85%>
<p align=center>Scanning Target Details
<p align=center><img src="science3.png", width=85%>
<p align=center>Long Range Scanner
<h3>COMMUNICATIONS SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the communications screen, you can hail starbases and other player ships and
control what is displayed on the "main screen" as well as activate the RED ALERT alarm.
You also control the ship's inventory and can interact with the ship's computer to
ask it questions or even use it to control almost any aspect of the ship.
<p align=center><img src="communications.png", width=85%>

<p>So what can Comms do with this terminal interface? First of all, anything
which is typed in that is not a command is broadcast on the current channel,
which is by default channel 0, which all player ships receive. You can also
switch channels, and only player ships tuned to the particular channel will
receive those messages. The intent here is for player-to-player chat in a
multi-bridge setup. The channel system is also used (implicitly) for
communications with starbases and with mining bots.

<p>Commands you can type in are preceded with a slash, '/', along the lines of IRC commands.
<pre>
    /help -- displays a list of commands (I need to update the help screen)
    /computer <english request for computer>",
    /channel channel-number - change current channel",
    /eject cargo-bay-number - eject cargo",
    /hail ship-name - hail ship or starbase on current channel",
    /inventory - report inventory of ship's cargo hold",
    /passengers - report list of passengers
    /about - report information about the game (i.e. version number, etc.)
</pre>
<p>Of the above, /hail, and /computer are the most powerful.

<p>/hail is how you communicate with starbases to request permission to dock,
or other things that starbases do (not all of which are implemented yet):
<pre>
    LOCAL TRAVEL ADVISORY
    REQUEST PERMISSION TO DOCK
    BUY WARP-GATE TICKETS
    REQUEST REMOTE FUEL DELIVERY
    BUY FUEL
    REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE
        BUY SHIELD SYSTEM PARTS
        IMPULSE DRIVE PARTS
        BUY WARP DRIVE PARTS
        BUY MANEUVERING PARTS
        BUY PHASER BANKS PARTS
        BUY SENSORS PARTS
        BUY COMMUNICATIONS PARTS
        BUY TRACTOR BEAM PARTS
    ARRANGE TRANSPORT CONTRACTS
        BUY CARGO
        SELL CARGO
        BOARD PASSENGERS
        DISEMBARK PASSENGERS
        EJECT PASSENGERS
    SIGN OFF
</pre>
<p>You may /hail other player ships, or mining bots. The mining bots have some
functionality accessed via comms:
<pre>
    STATUS REPORT
    RETURN TO SHIP
    TRANSPORT ORES TO CARGO BAYS
    STOW MINING BOT
    RETARGET MINING BOT
    SIGN OFF
</pre>
<p>The /computer command is the most powerful action the Comms officer can use,
with this, the entire ship may be controlled just by asking the computer to do
things in English. For example, stuff like this should all work:
<pre>
    /computer set a course for the nearest starbase
    /computer launch the mining bot
    /computer lower shields
    /computer set warp power to 100%
    /computer engage warp drive
    /computer turn left 10 degrees
    /computer engineering on screen
    /computer calculate a course to the nearest asteroid
    /computer describe <name of planet>
    /computer set warp drive coolant to 50 percent
</pre>
<h3>MAIN SCREEN</h3>
From the main screen, you can steer the ship.  The primary purpose of the main
screen view it to be projected on a large screen for all players to view at once.
<p align=center><img src="out-the-window.jpg", width=85%>
<h3>DEMON SCREEN</h3>
From the demon screen, the game master can inject all kinds of objects into
the game, direct NPC ships, run Lua scripts and construct scenarios to entertain
the other players.
<p align=center><img src="demon-screen.png", width=85%>

<h1>Multiplayer Setup</h1>
<p align=center><img src=multiplayer-setup.png>
<p align=center>What a typical multiplayer setup looks like.
<p><h2>Hardware for Multiplayer Setup</h2>
<p>You will need the following hardware:
<ul>
<li>A big TV or projector for the "Main Screen" view that you can drive
directly from a computer (e.g. chromecast likely will not work well.)
<li>A stereo or sound system of some type (something better than laptop speakers).
<li>Several reasonably powerful computers running linux (at least 3, preferably
5 per bridge).
<li>A network router or switch which can support as many computers as you're
planning to use.
Note: a <b>wired</b> router or switch is <b>strongly preferred</b> both for
performance reasons and for ease of configuration.
<li>(Optional) decent microphone or headset if you want to use the speech
recognition capabilities (need to reject background noise).
as you have.
</ul>
<h2>Software Components</h2>
<p>It helps to have a basic understanding of how the system works
in order to set it up and troubleshoot in case something doesn't work
like you expect.  The basic components of the system are:
<ul>
<li><b>ssgl_lobby</b> - This is the lobby server and is how all the other
parts of the system find one another.  There should be <em>exactly one</em> ssgl_server
process running in your system, on <em>one computer only</em>.  You will need to
know the IP address of the system that the lobby process (ssgl_server) runs
on.  This process has no graphics and no UI at all.
<li><b>snis_multiverse</b>This keeps track of player ships and stores
ship names, ship state, and ship password hashes.  This is what allows ships
to travel between solarsystems (between snis_server instances).  There should
be <em>exactly one</em> snis_multiverse process in your system.  This process has
no graphics and no UI at all.
<li><b>snis_server</b> - This runs the simulation of a solar system, its associated
planets, starbases, nebula, NPC ships, etc.  You need at least one snis_server, but
may have more than one.  This process has no graphics and no UI at all.
<li><b>snis_client</b> - This process is the face of SNIS, and is what the
player interacts with.  It is responsible for drawing all graphics and making
all sounds.  You need one snis_client process running for each player's computer
plus one for the "Main Screen".
</ul>
Note that the above diagram shows that <b>snis_server</b>, <b>snis_multiverse</b>,
and <b>ssgl_lobby</b> are all running on the same computer that controls the
projector and stereo, and this computer also runs a <b>snis_client</b> process
to drive the projector and stereo.  This is not a requirement.  The <b>snis_server</b>,
<b>snis_multiverse</b>, and <b>ssgl_lobby</b> processes could also run on
any other computers reachable on the network. It's usually just easiest to use a big
powerful desktop system for the "main screen" <b>snis_client</b> and then also run the
server processes on that system as well, and means the other computers are simpler to
set up, in that they are all identical, and only run a single process, <b>snis_client</b>.
<h2>Preliminary Hardware Setup</h2>
<p>The first thing that you need to do is get all the hardware into your game room,
arranged on furniture in such a way that everyone can see the big TV or projector,
connect it all up and make sure it is nominally working.  That means:
<ol>
<li>Figure out which computer will run <b>ssgl_server</b>, <b>snis_multiverse</b>, and
<b>snis_server</b>.  It is easiest if these will all run on the same computer, but
this is not a requirement.  For the purposes of these instructions we will assume this
is the case, and we will refer to this system as the <b>Main Computer</b>.  Usually
this will also be the same computer which is connected to the projector (or big TV)
and the stereo.  Again, this is not a requirement, but we will assume this is the case.
<li>Boot up all your computers and make sure every computer can "ping" the <b>Main Computer</b>.
If this doesn't work, the game won't work.  Note, many wireless routers
are configured to deliberately prevent local devices from talking to one another 
for security reasons on the assumption that they normally are only using the router
to get to the internet, not to communicate amongst themselves.  For this reason,
and for performance reasons, a <b>wired network switch or router is strongly
prefrerred</b>.
</ol>
<h2>Software Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install "Space Nerds In Space" on all computers.  Note, you should install <b>the same
version</b> on all computers.  The protocol used by <b>snis_server</b> and <b>snis_client</b>
to communicate with one another frequently changes, and if there is a mismatch, they won't
be able to talk to each other (in fact, will refuse to talk to one another most likely.)
Generally this means you should use the latest version from git on all computers.
<li>Install any additional art assets you might want to use (for extra solar systems)
from <a href="http://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space-assets">
http://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space-assets</a> on all your computers.
</ol>
<h3>Setting up the <b>Main Computer</b></h3>
<p>There is a script to help with setting up: <b>snis_launcher</b>.
<ol>
<li>Log into the <b>Main Computer</b> and run <b>snis_launcher</b>.  You should
see something like this (assuming your username is capnkirk):
<blockquote>
<pre>

This will quickly be covered over by the graphical display of the snis_client process which will look like this:
<p align=center><img src="network-setup.jpg", width=85%>
Make sure the MAIN SCREEN checkbox is checked.
<ul>
<li>If this is the very first time you have run the game, or if you intend to create a new
ship with a name you have never used before, then check the "CREATE SHIP" checkbox.  Otherwise
leave the CREATE SHIP checkbox unchecked.
<li>Leave the "JOIN SHIP" checkbox unchecked.
<li>Since ssgl_server is running on the same system as snis_client (our <b>Main Computer</b>),
it is fine to leave the LOBBY SERVER NAME OR IP ADDRESS field as "localhost".
<li>Enter your ship's name and password (these you make up.)
<li>Click on the CONNECT TO LOBBY button.
You should then see something like this, with one line for each <b>snis_server</b>
that you started (in this case, one.):
<p align=center><img src="lobby1.jpg", width=85%>
</ul>
<li>Click on the white text "DEFAULT2".  When you do that, you should see:
<p align=center><img src="lobby2.jpg", width=85%>
<li>Click on the "CONNECT TO SERVER" button on the right side of the screen.
After you do that, you should briefly see this:
<p align=center><img src="connecting.jpg">
<p>and after a short time, you should see the "main view", something like this:
<p align=center><img src="out-the-window.jpg", width=85%>
<li>Arrange things so this main view is appearing via your projector
or big TV.
<li>Choose <b>0</b> to exit the <b>snis_launcher</b> script.
<li>Make a note of the IP address(es) of the system running ssgl_server
(our <b>Main Computer</b>).  Run
<blockquote>
<pre>
capnkirk@enterprise$ ifconfig | grep 'inet addr'
          inet addr:<b>10.0.0.3</b>  Bcast:10.0.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet addr:<b>127.0.0.1</b>  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet addr:<b>10.236.226.31</b>  Bcast:10.255.255.255  Mask:255.224.0.0
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ol>
<h3>Setting up the <b>Bridge Stations</b></h3>
<p>Repeat the following steps for each bridge station.
<ol>
<li>Run <b>snis_launcher</b>. You should see:
<blockquote>
<pre>
capnkirk@enterprise $ ./snis_launcher 

     Welcome to Space Nerds In Space

   1. Launch SNIS lobby server
	The lobby server allows clients to find servers
	There should be one lobby server total.
   2. Launch SNIS multiverse server
	The multiverse server stores player ship data
	There should be one multiverse server total
   3. Launch SNIS server
	There should be one snis server per solarsystem.
	There should be at least one instance of snis_server.
   4. Launch SNIS client process
	There should be one snis client process per player
	plus one more per ship for the main screen.
   5. Stop all SNIS processes
   6. Stop all SNIS clients
   7. Stop all SNIS servers
   0. Quit
   Choose [0-7]:

Note that it shows "No SNIS processes are currently running."  This
is because this is a different computer (not the <b>Main Computer</b>).
<li>Choose <b>4</b> to start <b>snis_client</b>.  You should briefly see something like this:

which will quickly be covered up by the network setup screen, something like this:
<p align=center><img src="network-setup.jpg", width=85%>
<ul>
<li>Make sure MAIN SCREEN checkbox is <b>not</b> checked.
<li>Make sure CREATE SHIP checkbox is <b>not</b> checked.
<li>Make sure JOIN SHIP checkbox <b>is checked</b>.
<li>For LOBBY SERVER NAME OR IP ADDRESS enter the IP address that
you noted for the <b>MAIN COMPUTER</b> in step 10, above.
<li>For SHIP NAME and PASSWORD, enter the same name and password
you used for the <b>Main Computer</b> setup in step 5 above.
<li>Click the CONNECT TO LOBBY button.
You should then see something like this, with one line for each <b>snis_server</b>

<li>Click on the "CONNECT TO SERVER" button on the right side of the screen.
After you do that, you should see the snis_client graphical display appear.
Which screen it ends up on depends on what ROLES were selected on the
network setup screen.
<li>Use the function keys to select the appropriate station for this
console (e.g. if you mean for this to be the NAVIGATION station, press F2).
</ul>
</ol>
<p>That's it for the bridge station setup.  Repeat for each station.
