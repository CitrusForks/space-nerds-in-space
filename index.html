<p><b>Space Nerds In Space</b> is an open source (GPLv2) cooperative multiplayer
networked starship simulator for linux (may also work on Mac).
So go out and get together with a crew of your linux-nerd friends and their computers
in a room with a projector or TV, and go forth and explore the galaxy.

<p>One computer runs the central server simulation of the game's universe.  Each player's 
computer acts as a station on a simulated starship.  There are stations for
<b>Navigation, Weapons, Engineering, Communications, Damage Control,</b> and <b>the "Main View",</b>
an out-the-window 3d rendering.  Multiple starships each with their own team may
connect to the server for bridge-vs-bridge combat, or for cooperative play.  Additionally,
a game master may inject and control various NPC ships into the game to entertain the
players, and scenarios may be constructed with a Lua based scripting API.

<p>Here is a demo video from July 9, 2016, showing one of the mission scripts, "Saving Planet Erph".

<p>Here is a short mini-documentary created at <a href="http://txrxlabs.org">the premier
hackerspace of Houston, TX, TX/RX Labs</a>, camera work and editing by Jack Younger.
This is from 2013, and the graphics and other aspects of the game are much better now,
but this video will still give you a good idea of what the game is all about.

<p>There is a (so far)
<a href="http://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=3710">year long thread
on freegamedev.net</a> which is something like a development blog.

<p>The source code is here:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space">Space Nerds In Space github page</a>

<p><b>Build dependencies</b>
<ul>
<li>build-essential
<li>portaudio19-dev
<li>libvorbis-dev
<li>libgtk2.0-dev
<li>openscad
<li>libgtkglext1-dev 
<li>liblua5.2-dev 
<li>libglew1.5-dev
<li>libsdl2-2.0-0 # version may differ for your distro
<li>libsdl2-dev # version may differ for your distro
<li>libssl-dev
<li>libttspico-utils # for text to speech
</ul>

<p>If you want to try the speech recognition, you will want:
<ul>
<li>pocketsphinx-utils
<li>pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4
<li>pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4
<li>libpocketsphinx1
</ul>

<p>For development you probably also want
<ul>
<li>git
<li>stgit
<li>openscad # get it from http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
</ul>


<p>The above list may be incomplete, and these are the package names on mint 17 / ubuntu,
so may be different on RPM based systems.

<p>If you don't have linux, I have instructions for building a linux live DVD that you can 
play the game from without affecting your pre-existing OS install (but no guarantees -- it should
be ok, but don't come crying to me if this procedure trashes your hard drive.)

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcSUyKz3gfa9BG8X0DKkIMTnQag8_tJFQ">youtube
playlist of development videos for Space Nerds In Space</a> spanning the time from the very beginning
when the game was literally not much more than 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF19sPZGvmo&list=PLcSUyKz3gfa9BG8X0DKkIMTnQag8_tJFQ&index=20">just a bunch of dots on the screen</a> up until the present day.

<p>Here is a set of slides from a talk I gave about procedurally generating gas giant
planet textures: <a href="gaseous-giganticus-slides/slideshow.html">Procedurally Generating
Gas Giant Textures</a>.  
<p>Here are some pictures showing <a href="gaseous-giganticus-noise-scale.html">various noise-scales and the effect they have in gaseous-giganticus</a>.


<p>Here is a <a href="planetary-rings/example/slideshow.html">slideshow about the
implemenation of planetary rings and shadows cast by and on them</a> in Space Nerds
In Space.

<p>Here is a <a href="earthlike/example/slideshow.html">slideshow about 'earthlike'</a>, which
is a program used to generate some of the earthlike planet textures within Space Nerds In Space. 
(Use arrow keys to navigate the slideshow.  And press F11 for full screen.)

<p>Please keep in mind that this program is still very much a work in progress,
so there are a lot of rough edges and sharp corners everywhere, though the code
is pretty stable in the sense that it really doesn't crash much at all (if you
find it crashing, please let me know via <a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/issues?state=open">github's issue reporting system</a>.)

<p><b>Instructions for creating a Live DVD image to run the game</b>
<p>Warning: These instructions are likely to be out of date (2016-05-30)
<p>Warning: if this trashes your hard drive, you're on your own.  This procedure
worked for me, but you assume all risk and responsibility for the safety of your
data.

<p>These instructions assume you have a Mint 13 linux distro running to create the
DVD ISO image.  You can use virtualbox and install linux Mint 13 on the virtual 
machine to make the ISO, then when you're done, you can trash the virtual machine.
Linux Mint 13 ISO can be found here:
<a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/oldreleases.php">http://www.linuxmint.com/oldreleases.php</a>

<blockquote>
<font style="color:#7fff7f; background-color:#000000">
<pre>
  Install the package "mintconstructor" from the repositories
   sudo apt-get install mintconstructor

    Open a terminal
    Type sudo /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintConstructor/mintConstructor.py
    In the mintconstructor window that opens:
   In the "Directory" field, choose a directory for the ISO (use a new
   directory with nothing in it for this) Make sure to select the
   "New project" radio option
        Click the browse button on the right of the "ISO file" field and
   point it to your ISO file
   (in my case I used linuxmint-13-cinnamon-dvd-32bit.iso  from here: http://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=105
        Click "Next" and then "Yes" to confirm.

    Wait for it to do its thing for a bit, then click the button it
    presents to open a chrooted environment (it opens an xterm).  In
    the xterm:

    apt-get install build-essential
    apt-get install portaudio19-dev
    apt-get install libvorbis-dev
    apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
    apt-get install git
    apt-get install stgit
    apt-get install openscad
    apt-get install libgtkglext1-dev 
    apt-get install liblua5.2-dev 
    apt-get install libglew1.5-dev
</pre>
</font>
(hope I didn't miss any packages -- if you find I did, let me know.)

<p>If the openscad package isn't around, you can get it from here:
<font style="color:#7fff7f; background-color:#000000">
<pre>
	http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
</pre>
</font>
and then from outside the chrooted environment, copy
openscad-2013.0.x86-32.tar.gz into your chroot directory/root
<p>Then, back in the chrooted xterm:
<font style="color:#7fff7f; background-color:#000000">
<pre>

   cd /root
   tar xzvf openscad-2013.01.x86-32.tar.gz
   cd openscad-2013.01/
   ./install.sh
   cd ..

   git clone https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
   cd space-nerds-in-space/
   make
</pre>
</font>
<p>(now Space Nerds in Space has been built within the chrooted env.)

<p>Once you're finished making modifications, make sure to clean up with the following commands:

<p>Now clean up the chrooted env (and yes aptitude takes the weird tilde options for some reason):
<font style="color:#7fff7f; background-color:#000000">
<pre>
    aptitude purge ~c
    aptitude unmarkauto ~M
    apt-get clean; rm -rf /var/cache/debconf/*.dat-old; rm -rf /var/lib/aptitude/*.old; rm -rf /var/lib/dpkg/*-old; rm -rf /var/cache/apt/*.bin; updatedb
    history -c
    rm /root/.bash_history
    rm /root/.nano_history
    history -c
    exit
</pre>
</font>
<p>(xterm will close)
<p>Click Next
<p>Give your ISO a description (which will be embedded as the name of the CD
or USB stick onto which the ISO is burnt)  Don't pick too long of a name though
because if you do, it won't work.
<p>Click Next

<p>Iso image will be made

</blockquote>

<p>Then to run the game, burn the iso to dvd several times, and boot up all your machines from dvd.

<p>Open up a terminal, type "sudo su -"
(no password -- it's a live dvd)

<p>Then, cd to space-nerds-in-space

<p>Has to be root because we installed spacenerds in space into /root/space-nerds-in-space above when
making the dvd -- this could be worked around by chowning it all to user "mint", perhaps putting it someplace
else before making he ISO image, but I don't have the exact instructions to do that, and didn't think to do it,but if you're paranoid, you probably want to think about that.

<p>Repeat for several machines on your lan, say, five of them or so.

<p>On one machine that is connected to a projector, note the IP address:
(run ifconfig to figure this out.)

<p>Then start the snis client:
<font style="color:#7fff7f; background-color:#000000">
<pre>
./snis_client
</pre>
</font>

<p>From there, start the lobby server on localhost, start the gameserver, connect to lobby, and connect to the gameserver.
<p>Note the shipname and password you use (make up what you want).

<p>On the remaining machines, start snis_client, replace the lobby host "localhost" with the ip address noted above, fill in only the shipname and password as above, and connect to the lobby, then to the gameserver. You can be choosy about the 'roles' for each station at this point, but you don't have to.

<p>That's it.

<p>btw, prior to making live dvd iso's and burning a bunch of dvds, we tried to run the game in linux installed to virtual machines on the windows boxes -- that didn't work out so well, performance was kind of crap for whatever reason. With the dvds, performance was fine at least for the few minutes the network was working.  They were relatively low performance, inexpensive USB flash drives though.
