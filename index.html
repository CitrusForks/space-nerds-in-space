<p><b>Space Nerds In Space</b> is an open source (GPLv2) cooperative multiplayer
networked starship simulator for linux (may also work on Mac).
So go out and get together with a crew of your linux-nerd friends and their computers
in a room with a projector or TV, and go forth and explore the galaxy.

<p align=center>Here is a demo video from July 9, 2016, showing one of the mission scripts, "Saving Planet Erph".

<p>One computer runs the central server simulation of the game's universe.  Each player's 
computer acts as a station on a simulated starship.  There are stations for
<b>Navigation, Weapons, Engineering, Communications, Damage Control,</b> and <b>the "Main View",</b>
an out-the-window 3d rendering.  Multiple starships each with their own team may
connect to the server for bridge-vs-bridge combat, or for cooperative play.  Additionally,
a game master may inject and control various NPC ships into the game to entertain the
players, and scenarios may be constructed with a Lua based scripting API.

<p>Here is a short mini-documentary created at <a href="http://txrxlabs.org">the premier
hackerspace of Houston, TX, TX/RX Labs</a>, camera work and editing by Jack Younger.
This is from 2013, and the graphics and other aspects of the game are much better now,
but this video will still give you a good idea of what the game is all about.

<p>Space Nerds In Space was designed with hackerspaces in mind -- where else are you going to
find enough people to run a linux-based multi-player LAN game for Star Trek nerds but a
hackerspace?  The <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jPffJyj.png">very first 3D model</a> created
for Space Nerds In Space may seem <a href="https://twitter.com/cbase">strikingly familiar</a>.
If you're a member of a hackerspace, this game is explicitly <em>made for you</em>.

<h1>Build Instructions</h1>
<h2>Step 0: Acquire Hardware and OS</h2>
<p>This is a linux game.  You will need a computer running linux.
A raspberry pi doesn't count, it's not powerful enough.  The game is
currently developed using <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/">Mint 17.3</a>
It is within the realm of possibility that the game could be made to build
and work on Mac OSX (it has been done before, but not within the last
couple years.)  You're on your own if you want to try to run it on Mac.

<h2>Step 1: Install Dependencies</h2>
<p><b>Build dependencies</b>
<pre>
<blockquote>
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install portaudio19-dev
apt-get install libvorbis-dev
apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
apt-get install git
apt-get install stgit
apt-get install openscad # or get it from http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html
apt-get install libgtkglext1-dev
apt-get install liblua5.2-dev
apt-get install libglew1.5-dev
apt-get install libssl-dev
apt-get install libttspico-utils # for text to speech
apt-get install sox # for "play" command, used by text to speech
apt-get install espeak # optional alternative to libttspico-utils
apt-get install alsa-utils # optional alternative to sox, for "aplay" command
apt-get-install libsdl1.2-dev # optional, only needed for mesh_viewer
</blockquote>
</pre>

<blockquote>
Note: SDL should only be required if you want to build mesh_viewer,
which is a utility program for viewing 3D models, and which is not
required to run the game.  mesh_viewer uses SDL 1.2, not SDL 2.x
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to try the optional speech recognition, you will want the following packages:
<pre>
<blockquote>
apt-get install pocketsphinx-utils
apt-get install pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4
apt-get install pocketsphinx-lm-en-hub4
apt-get install libpocketsphinx1
</blockquote>
</pre>

<p>The above list may be incomplete, and these are the package names on mint 17.3 / ubuntu,
so may be different on RPM based systems.

<h2>Step 2: Download the Source Code</h2>

<p>The source code is here:
<a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space">Space Nerds In Space github page</a>
To get it, there are three methods:
<ul>
<li>If you are a registered github user, type:
<pre>
<blockquote>
git clone git@github.com:smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
<blockquote>
</pre>
<li>If not a registered github user, you can still use git with https.  Type:
<pre>
<blockquote>
git clone https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space.git
<blockquote>
</pre>
<li>Finally, you can just download a snapshot zipfile without using git at all:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/archive/master.zip">
https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/archive/master.zip</a>
</ul>
<p>After downloading, you must unpack the zip file.  Type:
<pre>
<blockquote>
unzip space-nerds-in-space-master.zip 
cd space-nerds-in-space-master
</blockquote>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Build the Code</h2>
<p>To build the code, make sure you are in the top level
directory for the game ("space-nerds-in-space" if you
got the source using git, or "space-nerds-in-space-master" if you
downloaded the zip file), and type:
<pre><blockquote>
make O=1
</blockquote></pre>
<p>You should see quite a lot of output, like this:
<pre>
<blockquote>
  COMPILE mathutils.c
  COMPILE snis_alloc.c
  COMPILE snis_socket_io.c

... many steps omitted here ...

  LINK snis_server
  LINK snis_client
  LINK snis_limited_client
  LINK snis_multiverse
</blockquote>
</pre>

<p>If you have problems building the code, it likely means there is some
missing dependency.  Double check that you have all the required dependencies
installed.

<p>You can also file a bug report if you think you have discovered a problem
with the build process, or the instructions here.  I believe you will need a github
account to file a bug report.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/smcameron/space-nerds-in-space/issues">Click here to file a bug report</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Step 4. Run the Game (on a single system)</h2>
<p>Type:
<blockquote>
<pre>
	./quickstart
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: This will run both the "server" and the "client" on your machine.
After awhile, you should see a screen that looks something like this
(without the white ovals):
<p align=center><img src="network-setup.jpg", width=85%>

<ol>
<li>Click on the MAIN SCREEN ROLE checkbox to be sure it is checked.
<li>The <em>very first</em> time you run it, leave the CREATE SHIP box
checked.  On subsequent runs, make sure CREATE SHIP is not checked.
<li>Enter the name of your ship in the "SHIP NAME" field.
<li>Choose a password for your ship and enter it in the PASSWORD field.
(Note: the passwords are not cryptographically secure.)
<li>Click the "CONNECT TO LOBBY" button in the lower left part of the screen
</ol>
<p>Once connected to the lobby, you should see something like this:
<p align=center><img src="lobby1.jpg", width=85%>
<p>Click on the white text "DEFAULT2".  When you do that, you should see:
<p align=center><img src="lobby2.jpg", width=85%>
<p>Click on the "CONNECT TO SERVER" button on the right side of the screen.
After you do that, you should briefly see this:
<p align=center><img src="connecting.jpg">
<p>and then this should quickly be replaced be an "out the window" view
of space, as below, the "main screen" view of Space Nerds In Space.  It may not look
exactly like this as your ship will be placed in a semi-random location facing
an arbitrary direction.  If you've gotten this far, congratulations, you're doing
better than most.
<p align=center><img src="out-the-window.jpg", width=85%>
<h2>Step 5. Play around</h2>
<h3>Keyboard Controls</h3>
<p>The function keys are used to switch between screens, except for F1, which is the 'help' key.
<ul>
<li>F1 is the help screen.  What it displays depends on which screen you're on.
<li>F2 - NAVIGATION
<li>F3 - WEAPONS
<li>F4 - ENGINEERING
<li>F5 - DAMAGE CONTROL
<li>F6 - SCIENCE
<li>F7 - COMMUNICATIONS
<li>F8 - MAIN SCREEN
<li>F9 - DEMON SCREEN (dungeon master screen)
</ul>
<p>To quit the game, press ESC and confirm using arrow keys and ENTER.
Note, this only quits your client process.
You can re-join the server (via "./quickjoin" script)
It still leaves several processes running, the snis_server, the lobby process
and snis_multiverse.  To kill all of them, run the "./killem" script.
<h3>NAVIGATION SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the navigation screen, you can steer the ship and maneuver around. 
<p align=center><img src="navigation.png", width=85%>
<h3>WEAPONS SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the weapons screen, you can fire the laser turret and launch torpedoes.
<p align=center><img src="weapons.jpg", width=85%>
<h3>ENGINEERING SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the engineering screen, you can control how power and coolant is distributed
to the various systems of the ship.
<p align=center><img src="engineering.png", width=85%>
<h3>DAMAGE CONTROL SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the damage control screen, you can repair the various systems of the ship.
<p align=center><img src="damage-control.png", width=85%>
<h3>SCIENCE SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the science screen, you can scan ships, planets, asteroids, launch the mining
robot and help navigate to distant targets.
<p align=center><img src="science1.png", width=85%>
<p align=center>Short Range Scanner
<p align=center><img src="science2.png", width=85%>
<p align=center>Scanning Target Details
<p align=center><img src="science3.png", width=85%>
<p align=center>Long Range Scanner
<h3>COMMUNICATIONS SCREEN</h3>
<p>From the communications screen, you can hail starbases and other player ships and
control what is displayed on the "main screen" as well as activate the RED ALERT alarm.
You also control the ship's inventory and can interact with the ship's computer to
ask it questions or even use it to control almost any aspect of the ship.
<p align=center><img src="communications.png", width=85%>
<h3>MAIN SCREEN</h3>
From the main screen, you can steer the ship.  The primary purpose of the main
screen view it to be projected on a large screen for all players to view at once.
<p align=center><img src="out-the-window.jpg", width=85%>
<h3>DEMON SCREEN</h3>
From the demon screen, the game master can inject all kinds of objects into
the game, direct NPC ships, run Lua scripts and construct scenarios to entertain
the other players.
