This is some preliminary code for a multiplayer networked spaceship bridge simulator game inspired by "Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator"

There are three parts.

1. ssgl/ssgl_server is the game lobby.  "ssgl" stands for "super simple game lobby".  (There is a github project, "ssgl", but the code in here is more up to date than that.)  This does matchmaking between snis_client and snis_server processes.  It does not do NAT punchthrough, so it's a LAN only thing.  It needs the following lines in /etc/services:

gamelobby	2419/tcp
gamelobby	2419/udp

2.  snis_server:  This is the Space Nerds In Space game server.  This runs the simulation of the space-nerds-in-space universe.  There are two threads per client, one to read, and one to write.  The simulation, runs, and periodically changed state is dumped out to all the client writer threads, and by this means the clients are updated.   The reader threads gather inputs from the clients and these inputs are fed into the simulation.

3. snis_client:  There can be many instances of this.  The plan is there should be one instance per "station" on each "starship".  These process receive input from the snis_server process and display this data in whatever form is suitable for whichever starship station is being provided (e.g. navigation, weapons, communication, engineering, science, etc.)  (Currently any instance of snis_client can do any of the available functions to whatever degree they are implemented (As of Nov 2012, mostly not implemented.))

The snis_client programs need not run on the same server as the snis_server nor on the same server as each other, and the ssgl_server may run on yet another system.

The sequence to run this thing is:

a) start snis_client (several instances, one per bridge station per team)
b) From *one* of the clients, start the lobby server, and a game server.
c) For each client, select the role.  Selecting no roles is the same as
   selecting all roles.
d) Connect the clients to the lobby, and then from there connect to the
   game server.  Each client should use the ship name and password for
   the team they are on (this is just something the players make up and
   agree upon.  There should be one shipname/password combo for each
   "team", or starship, in the simulation.

2) press function keys f1,f2,f3,f4,f5,f6, etc. on each client to switch between
   the roles that station fulfills.

That's about all the instructions I have for now.
