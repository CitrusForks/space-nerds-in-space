Space Nerds In Space is an open source multiplayer networked spaceship bridge
simulator game inspired by another game called "Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator"
It is still a work in progress, but it is substantially far along, and reasonably
free of bugs as far as I know (the game should not crash, in other words.)

1. How to build the game from source:

2. How to run the game on a single machine (single player):

3. How to run with a multi-player LAN setup:
